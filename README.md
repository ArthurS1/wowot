### Commit format

When writing a commit, please use the following format :

- A description of less than 80 characters
- Why the changes were made / how were they made (optional)

Please use multi line commits when adding descriptions.

#### Example of a correct commit:

```
Update system tests script removing build step

We should stack build with --exec. That is the
proper way to execute something at the end of a build
else it will get very confused and exit before
finishing.

The script is needed because we cannot launch
shelltest within exec for reasons that i don't
quite understand...
```

### Merge policy
